      <description>I am glad to anounce that my new ARDL package has been published on CRAN! This is part of my Ph.D. at the University of Thessaly under the supervision of the Associate Professor Nickolaos Tzeremes.
The ARDL package functionality consists mainly of three things (more to come in future updates):
 Dynamic time-series regression models (ARDL and ECM)
 Bounds-test for cointegration (Pesaran et al. (2001))
 Long-run multipliers (short-run and interim multipliers are comming in the next update)</description>
