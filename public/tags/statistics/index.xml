      <description>This is the first post of the series do it right. This series of posts is about usual misuses of methods that are supposed to be basics but many of us keep doing them in a wrong way.
ANOVA is taught in the university as one of our first steps in statistics after some basic probability theory, distributions and t-test. It is used as a means of measuring the differences among sample means and is practically an F-test.</description>
