      <description>It all started when I was trying to do some joint restriction on the regression’s coefficients… in Julia… and I failed… And this is because there is no function (at least yet) to perform a Wald test on the estimated regression model. So I made it! In short, I just rewrote the wald.test function from the aod package in R, and created a new function for Julia. It’s called, guess what… wald_test.</description>

      <description>This is the first post of the series do it right. This series consist of posts that aim to give an alternative and simple view on usual misunderstandings and misuses of methods.
ANOVA is taught in the university as one of our first steps in statistics after some basic probability theory, distributions and t-test. It is used as a means of measuring the differences among sample means and is practically an F-test.</description>
