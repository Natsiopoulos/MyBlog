My name is Kleanthis Natsiopoulos. I live in Greece and my academic background is in Economics and Statistics, while I have worked as a Data Analyst in the oil and shipping industry. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Thessaly. My broad research interests include econometrics, machine learning, computational economics, statistics but most of all the combination of the above.
